drools_codes
============

some practice codes of drools/Jboss
1. Sorry for all these many codes with wrong folder names etc...
2. the codes will either be imported in eclipse or in netbeans
3. make sure you included some library files in case they are missing
4. the are some very simple codes, sample codes and some are very complex like matching regex.
5. most complex one is matching regular expression but in cases it might not be able to do so.
